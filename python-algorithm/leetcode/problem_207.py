"""207. Course Schedule
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take,
labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites,
for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1,
which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs,
is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Constraints:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
1 <= numCourses <= 10^5
